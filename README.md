# Crossy Road with three.js



An interactive tech demo inspired by Crossy Road using three.js where I put together a scene with an orthographic camera that follows the player, a few simplified 3D objects with some texture, lights and shadows,  and a basic game logic that randomly generates a level that you can walk through.
